# Problem Statement : 
    Predicting Symptoms of users using Deep Learning
### Pitch :
    Given Data has minimum correlation and is very dynamic as it changes from person to person and also depends on various other
    unrelated factors . So as the data is randomly distributed, with no specific trend so we are using Deep Neural Networks on
    the data, and doing supervised learing by considering the factors period cycle and period length. Using this we are trying to 
    predict her symptoms during their menstrual cycle.
### Utility :
    Basing on these Symptoms one would be able to know about one's pesonal health profile, hygiene. It also can be used to take
    precautionary measures in extreme cases as we will be able to predict the symptoms early.
